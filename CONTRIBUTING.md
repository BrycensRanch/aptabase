2. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
3. Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
4. Clone the repo
5. Start all dependencies with `docker compose up -d`
6. Copy `src/Properties/launchSettings.example.json` to `src/Properties/launchSettings.json`
7. Navigate to `src/` and run `npm install` and `dotnet restore` to install dependencies
8. While on `src/`, run `dotnet watch` to start the server in watch mode
9. In another terminal, also on `src/`, run `npm run dev` to start the client in watch mode
10. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the app

That's it! You're ready to start writing some code ðŸš€
